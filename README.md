# MPVR

## Embedding MPV as a OpenVR overlay

- very rough but it works
- proof of concept atm using libmpv to embed an instance of the mpv media player in the context of a openvr overlay using rawdraw

- also included is the simple example from [https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv-examples/tree/master/libmpv]
- libmpv dll and include files are from [https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/libmpv/]
- [rawdraw](https://github.com/cntools/rawdraw)
